2025/1/16 - added support of setting SQLite db location via config file
2025/3/21 - added FolderManager class
2025/3/22 - removed FolderManager. Improved folder size determination mechanism


TO DO List / Items which are missing and must be added:

(DONE)		1. Categories should be permitted to be assigned to a folderpath as well.
(DONE)		2. Network/mapped drives are not currently supported - this is a serious limitation for those people using a NAS.  
(DONE)		3. Only files at the root level are currently associated with a category. There should be no folder depth limit.
(DONE)		4. GUI - Add a search capability to find files of a specific category
(ONGOING)	5. The 'GUI/front-end' to manage and view the data does not yet exist.
			6. There is no support for folders/files/categories which have been removed.
			7. The service stop code needs improvement.
			8. Overall application performance needs improving
			9. More GUI features (exclusion lists)
			10. Startup code needs improving
			11. Cleanup the documentation
			12. There is a (performance) change that I can made which will help in determining folder size. 
(CRITICAL)	13. More Testing - There are bugs to be fixed. For instance, folder size is not adjusted on changes. 


Possible additional improvements:
1. I'm not sure how good the approach used for folder/file searching is. Consider: cpu usage and effect to other tasks. 
2. Add a DB caching layer (but it needs to be justified)
