2025/1/16 - added support of setting SQLite db location via config file
2025/3/21 - added FolderManager class
2025/3/22 - removed FolderManager. Improved folder size determination mechanism


To Do list:
the db file location will default to the service's installed location if there is no entry or the entry is invalid.
a dummy sqllite db file with the proper structure will be created at that time.
