2024/11/06 - added support for mapped drive locations
             categories can now be assigned to a folder
             removed code that computes folder size - this is extremely slow. to consider: new approach
             now stores files for folders specified in the category table, including sub-folders
             bug fixes

2024/11/27 - refactored the folder scanning code

2024/11/28 - removed use of WMI via MappedDriveResolver. This was failing when code was executing as a service.
             I tried various approaches with no luck.
             Replaced MappedDriveResolver with UNCPath() - a method which uses the registry.
             
             Note: The service works fine when run under a microsoft admin user account but not with the windows service account. 
                   I need to improve upon this. 
        
2024/11/29 - added a simple WPF gui

2024/12/02 - GUI improvements, application now computes folder size when all sub-folders have been scanned 


// TO DO:

//      the service should be permitted to work with the service account.
//      the grid search refresh should be improved (use caching)
//      add configuration screen
//      replace data storage layer with perhaps sqlite.
//      use seperate grid row colors to distinguish folders from files
//      for file/foldersize, use abbrevations where required (kb, mb, gb, tb, etc ..)
