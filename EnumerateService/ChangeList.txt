             bug fixes

2024/11/27 - refactored the folder scanning code

2024/11/28 - removed use of WMI via MappedDriveResolver. This was failing when code was executing as a service.
             I tried various approaches with no luck.
             Replaced MappedDriveResolver with UNCPath() - a method which uses the registry.
             
             Note: The service works fine when run under a microsoft admin user account but not with the windows service account. 
                   I need to improve upon this.
