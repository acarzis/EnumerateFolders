2024/11/06 - added support for mapped drive locations
             categories can now be assigned to a folder
             removed code that computes folder size - this is extremely slow. to consider: new approach
             now stores files for folders specified in the category table, including sub-folders
             bug fixes

2024/11/27 - refactored the folder scanning code

2024/11/28 - removed use of WMI via MappedDriveResolver. This was failing when code was executing as a service.
             I tried various approaches with no luck.
             Replaced MappedDriveResolver with UNCPath() - a method which uses the registry.
             
             Note: The service works fine when run under a microsoft admin user account but not with the windows service account. 
                   I need to improve upon this. 
        
2024/11/29 - added a simple WPF gui

2024/12/02 - GUI improvements, application now computes folder size when all sub-folders have been scanned 

2024/12/09 - GUI now retrieves all data from repo during startup and uses it for subsequent operations.
             Changes to search functionality: search now requires search text to be in folder name or path 

2024/12/12 - GUI now allows filtering for folders or files. Added a search results refresh feature.
2024/12/16 - GUI improvements, added simple configuration screen. Work is INCOMPLETE.
2025/01/11 - Added support for SQLite
2025/01/16 - Added support for configuring location of SQLite db file via config file. 


TO DO List:
      - (DONE) replace data storage layer with perhaps sqlite or LiteDB.
      - (DONE) for file/foldersize, use abbrevations where required (kb, mb, gb, tb, etc ..) 
      - the service should be permitted to work with the service account.
      - add support of folder/drive exclusions
      - improve configuration where required

      MAJOR: 
      - application needs to be improved in terms of operational speed (search and file scan).
        the application is far too slow as is. a re-design may be required
