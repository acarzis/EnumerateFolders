List of Changes:
-------------------
2025/1/16
- added support of setting SQLite db location via config file
  
  Deficiency: EnumerateGUI will not execute if the service is not running.
  Why so? Because the GUI examines the location of the service exacutable and extracts its config file to obtain the DB location.
  It should be noted that config files (via ConfigurationManager) are associated with running assemblies, not dlls/libraries.
  Reminder, there may be multiple instances of a dll (for example, EnumerateFolders.dll) active at any  given time.
  Although the config screen can change the enumerate service's db location, the service must be restarted if that locaiton is to 
  be made active.
