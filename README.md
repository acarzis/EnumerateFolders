# EnumerateFolders

I created this 'app' because I wanted a means to do the following:

1. Get a visual representation of how I am wasting my hard drive space.
2. Have the size of each of my drive folders always available.
3. Do the above using .Net EF Code First for the sake of learning and ease of development

Note: This is unfinished work. A lot of the code is in place but improvements are needed here and there. 
As well as major GUI improvements. 

App history is available in the ChangeList.txt file.

Update:
I am re-writing this app in C++ using a different approach - all oeprations will be done against an in memory database which is periodically written to a database in an efficient manner.
