# EnumerateFolders

I created this 'app' because I wanted a means to do the following:

1. Get a visual representation of how I am wasting my hard drive space.
2. Have the size of each of my drive folders always available.
3. Do the above using .Net EF Code First for the sake of learning and ease of development
